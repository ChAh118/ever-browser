## Usage statistics collection in Ever Browser

By default, Ever Browser sends some statistics about how it's used. Currently, these include:

* Your operating system and computer language
* When you installed Ever Browser
* The version of Ever Browser that you're using
* How often you use certain features in Ever Browser
* An anonymous ID representing your installation of Ever Browser

Collecting this data allows us to prioritize which devices and operating systems we test and which features we work on.

Ever Browser does not send:
* Anything that can be used to personally identify you
* Any browsing history, passwords, or other data stored locally in Ever Browser

If you want to opt-out of statistics collection, you can do so by going to the preferences page within Ever Browser and de-selecting "send usage statistics".
